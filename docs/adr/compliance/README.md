# ADR Compliance Statements

This directory contains **compliance statements** for each Architectural Decision Record (ADR) under `docs/adr`.

Each file summarises:

- The **overall compliance status** (e.g. Compliant, Substantially Compliant).
- Key **evidence of alignment** between the repository and the ADR’s decisions.
- Any known **gaps, deviations, or future work**.

Current compliance files:

- `0001-rules-of-engagement-compliance.md`
- `0002-tech-stack-and-testing-compliance.md`
- `0003-auth-and-roles-compliance.md`
- `0004-https-transport-security-compliance.md`
- `0005-world-entities-domain-model-compliance.md`
- `0006-campaigns-sessions-scenes-compliance.md`
- `0007-no-inline-styles-compliance.md`

As new ADRs are added, create a corresponding `NNNN-*-compliance.md` file here to track implementation status and any intentional drift.
